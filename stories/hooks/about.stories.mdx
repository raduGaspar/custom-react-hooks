# React Hooks

<br /><br />

## What are hooks?
Hooks is a new API for React introduced in version 16.8 (released in February 2019). They let us use
state and other React features without writing classes.

The main motivation behind this new API was the ability of creating reusable logic, including state,
and plugging it into React components. So the goal is similar to Higher Order Components or Render
Props patterns, but Hooks resolve a lot of the issues of its predecessors and are much simpler to
use. Another big benefit is the possibility to put interconnected logic close to each other, and in
reality components using hooks result in much shorter code. In general they provide a good developer
experience.

## Custom React Hooks

These hooks were created to serve as reusable pieces of code across your React projects. They solve
commonly occurring issues within application development.

These hooks are meant to be used without adding additional dependencies to your project; that's why
they're not part of an `npm` package. Just copy what you need and use it like that - all of the hooks
are independent of each other.
