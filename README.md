### How to Use
___
- All you really need from the repo are the custom hooks. They can be found in the `src` folder; everything else is for documentation and presentation purposes only.
- If you're planning on using react hooks you need to be running [`React 16.8+`](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [`ReactDOM 16.8+`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) at a minimum!

#### Running this locally
```bash
# install all of the dependencies (if necessary)
npm i

# run it
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
